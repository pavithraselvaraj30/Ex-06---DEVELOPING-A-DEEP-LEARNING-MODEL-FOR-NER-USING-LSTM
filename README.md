Ex 06 - DEVELOPING A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR NER USING LSTM

## AIM
To develop an LSTM-based model for recognizing the named entities in the text.

## THEORY
Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
STEP 1:
Load data, create word/tag mappings, and group sentences.

STEP 2:
Convert sentences to index sequences, pad to fixed length, and split into training/testing sets.

STEP 3:
Define dataset and DataLoader for batching.

STEP 4:
Build a bidirectional LSTM model for sequence tagging.

STEP 5:
Train the model over multiple epochs, tracking loss.

STEP 6:
Evaluate model accuracy, plot loss curves, and visualize predictions on a sample.
